# Password-Generator

After completing half of my Scrimba javascript course I pursued a solo project of creating a password generator, this web application generates two random passwords and takes user's input to generate a password length of their choosing (1 - 16) characters.

It can be viewed using this Netlify link : https://sidpassgenerator.netlify.app/pass.html

This project uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS
