# Password-Generator

After completing half of my Scrimba javascript course I pursued a solo project of creating a password generator, this web application generates two random passwords and takes user's input for to generate a password length of their choosing (1 - 16) characters.

I got the idea for the project from my Scimba course , but all the code is from my own doing.

This project uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS
